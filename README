-bashrc: is my rc file for bash, it also redirects to aliases
-conkyrc: is my rc file for conky, also contains my conky theme elements.
-vimrc: is my rc for for vim, uses vundle for plugin support.

-zshrc: is my rc file for zsh, it also redirects to aliases.

/config

-rc.lua: is my awesome config file, theme is not included as it uses default.

/scripts
# Located anywhere, these files are scripts I have either written or compiled from other sources to perform specific actions. 

-updatemirriors.sh: is a sh script I use to get the best and fastest mirrors for pacman.
